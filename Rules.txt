                           | MEXICAN TRAIN INSTRUCTIONS |
                            ----------------------------

--------------------------
 SPECIAL FOR THIS VERSION
--------------------------

 Private trains are marked in red.
 Public trains are marked in green.
 Once you've played a domino on a train, it is final! You can't take it back.
 Also note that the double-blank domino is worth 50 points.

------
 GOAL
------

 The goal of Mexican Train is to be the first player to lay down all of your dominoes.

-------
 SETUP
-------

 Shuffle the dominoes, face down, on the table. Each player takes the appropriate 
   number of dominoes (see below) and stands them on edge, so that they can see the 
   faces (the side with the pips) but their opponents cannot.

 Number of players:
   For 2-3 players, use a double-9  set and each player takes 15
   For   4 players, use a double-12 set and each player takes 15
   For 5-6 players, use a double-12 set and each player takes 12
   For 7-8 players, use a double-12 set and each player takes 11

 The remaining dominoes are left on the table face down. This supply is known as the 
   boneyard.

------------
 GAME START
------------

 The player with the double-12 (or double-9 when playing with 2-3 players) starts the
   first round by placing the double-12 in the center of the table. This domino serves 
   as the "engine" for the round.

 Each later round starts with the player who has drawn the next-lowest double. For 
   example, the player who draws the double-11 in the second round starts that round. 
   The 13th and final round begins with the player who draws the double-blank.

 If there is a situation where no player has drawn the tile required to begin the
   round, players take turns drawing from the boneyard until it is found. The player 
   who draws it starts the round.

------------
 FIRST TURN
------------

 The start player now starts to build a train (a single row of dominoes) starting from 
   the center domino and moving toward the player. The end of the domino placed near 
   the engine must match the engine's double number. (Example: If the engine is a 
   double-12, the end of the domino placed near the engine must be a 12. The other end 
   can be anything at all.)

 Taking turns in a clockwise direction, the other players do the same.

 NOTE: For the first turn, and only the first turn, players may place as many dominoes 
   as they wish as long as they continue forming a valid train. (A valid train is 
   formed when the ends of adjacent dominoes match.) If a player is able to play all of 
   his dominoes on the first turn, the round ends after each player has had one turn.

 If a player cannot start a train on the first turn, they place a marker where a domino 
   would have been placed to indicate that they could not start a train. (They do not 
   draw any dominoes from the boneyard.) On the second turn and all subsequent turns, 
   any player can play dominoes in marked areas. On the first turn, the only options 
   for each player are to start a train or to pass.

-------------------
 THE MEXICAN TRAIN
-------------------

 Starting with the second turn, any player can start the Mexican Train by starting a 
   new train in the same way that they started their own train (i.e., the end of the 
   domino placed near the engine must match the engine's double number).

-----------------------------
 SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT TURNS
-----------------------------

 After the first turn, play continues in a clockwise direction. However, each player is 
   limited to placing a single domino per turn, unless the domino is a double.

 The single domino played may be added to the player's own train, to another player's 
   train if that train is marked "public" (indicating the owner could not play a domino 
   on the previous move), or to the Mexican Train. The Mexican Train is always open to 
   all players.

 Each domino must always be played so that it continues forming a valid train.

 If a player cannot place a domino, he must draw one from the boneyard. He may then 
   play this domino, if a legal play exists. If he cannot play, his train is marked as 
   public and the next player takes a turn. (If no dominoes remain in the boneyard, it 
   will be the same as if the player drew a domino he could not play.

 When a player adds a domino to his own train, and his train has been marked public,
   his train then becomes private again and other players are no longer allowed to add 
   to it.

---------
 DOUBLES
---------

 Starting with the second turn, any time a player places a double tile (both ends have 
   the same number of pips), he may play a second domino to "satisfy the double," 
   which means that he plays a tile to that open double. If the player cannot satisfy
   the double, his turn is over.

 The next player to go must now try to satisfy the double, even if the move would 
   otherwise be illegal. If the next player cannot satisfy the double, he must draw a 
   domino from the boneyard -- if one is available. If the boneyard domino cannot be 
   used to satisfy the double, or none is available, his train is marked public and the 
   play moves on to the next player. This will continue until someone satisfies the
   double.

 If no dominoes are left in the boneyard and none of the players are able to satisfy 
   the double, the round will end.
  
---------
 SCORING
---------

 When one player places his final domino, or when no player has a legal play, the game 
   ends. At this point, scores are calculated.

 The player going out receives zero points. Each other player adds the sum of the pips 
   on their dominoes to determine their score, with the double-blank domino counting as 
   50 points.

---------
 WINNING
---------

 After all rounds have been completed, the player with the fewest points wins.
   If there is a tie, the player who scored the most zero-point rounds wins. If there 
   is still a tie at this point, the player with the lowest total in a round, other 
   than zero, wins.
